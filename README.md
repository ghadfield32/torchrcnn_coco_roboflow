Torch Faster R-CNN for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation

Welcome to our comprehensive repository, designed to facilitate the streamlined implementation of Torch Faster R-CNN for object detection and instance segmentation with CUDA acceleration. This framework is crafted to be highly accessible, enabling both training and video processing with minimal setup, and harnesses the combined power of PyTorch, Roboflow, and CUDA for optimal performance.
Overview

This solution aims to democratize advanced computer vision capabilities, allowing users to effortlessly train models and process videos directly from YouTube. It integrates seamlessly with Roboflow for dataset management, optimizing for performance on CUDA-supported hardware, and provides a host of features to enhance the user experience and model effectiveness.
Features

    One-Line Training: Initiate model training with just a single command, compatible with CLI or Jupyter notebooks.
    CUDA Integration: Automatic detection and utilization of CUDA for performance optimization on supported hardware.
    Roboflow Integration: Streamlined dataset loading, including automatic downloads and data preparation with automatic class management.
    Custom Image Processing: Adapts COCO annotations for compatibility with Faster R-CNN, including bbox format conversion.
    Model Customization: Facilitates easy adjustment of hyperparameters for tailored training experiences.
    Video Processing: Processes videos from YouTube, allowing immediate application and evaluation of trained models on real-world data.
    Intersection Checking: Enables tracking interactions between specified classes in video analysis for enhanced performance insights.
    Clean-up Option: Option to automatically delete downloaded datasets and videos post-processing to maintain a clean workspace.

Quick Start

    Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    bash

!git clone https://github.com/ghadfield32/torchrcnn_coco_roboflow

%cd torchrcnn_coco_roboflow/

!pip install -r requirements.txt

Train the model with:

bash 

!python train.py --api_key api_key \
                --workspace basketball-formations \
                --project_name basketball-and-hoop-7xk0h \
                --project_folder_name basketball-and-hoop \
                --mode train 

Options to add:
                --delete_folder_and_video True \
                --version 11 \
                --hidden_layer 256 \
                --lr 0.005 \
                --num_epochs 1 \
                --threshold 0.6 \

To process a video and analyze the results, update the mode and specify the YouTube URL:

bash

!python train.py --mode process_video \
    --video_url "<YouTube URL>" \
    --video_name "Youtube video name"

Options to add:
    --delete_folder_and_video True \
    --check_intersections True \
    --classes_to_track Basketball Hoop \
